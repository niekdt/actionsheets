**Actionsheets** is an open-source hobby project with a different take on cheatsheets. 
Standard cheatsheets are great for getting started, but don't get into the details for advanced or complex use cases.
This is where actionsheets come in.

## Getting started
Click a programming language in the top bar, and then select or search an actionsheets.


## How do actionsheets differ from cheatsheets?
- Actionsheets are expressed in terms of a desired *action* or result, and the code snippet(s) to achieve it.
  - This is a more natural way to look up code snippets. Especially useful for beginners.
- Actions may be complex or comprise multiple steps.
  - Actions are not limited to the direct functionality provided by the package API. 
  - Cheatsheets typically lack more advanced compound use cases.
- Code snippets are data; enabling dynamic generation of sheets depending on user queries
  - Sheets can therefore be more feature-complete, as they do not need fit on a single page.
    
This way of organizing sheets is especially useful for packages or functions with powerful versatile functionality, where merely listing the API does not cover the full capabilities. 

## Motivation
My motivation for building this curated database of code snippet is out of frustration of the worsening state of the internet in quickly finding short answers to straightforward queries.

- Many website have the code snippet(s) buried between tons of irrelevant text just for SEO optimization.
- The quality of (accepted) answers on Stackoverflow is severely lacking for some programming languages:
  - Answers are out of date
  - Answers are overly complicated or inefficient (contributions by beginners)
  - For the future, this also means that the answers by any LLM are going to have the same issues. 
- The answer on the site was for a different question
- The answer on the site was for a more narrow question
- With the increasing usage of LLMs, the problem of bloated low-quality answer results will only get worse.
