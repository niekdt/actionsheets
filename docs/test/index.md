# Test actionsheet 

=== "Description"

    An ordered collection of elements.

=== "Details"

    Tips:

    - Lists can be efficiently used as a stack through append() (for push) and pop().
    - Sorting seems to be broken for numeric lists containing NaN

=== "Code"

    ```py
    def lol():
        return 2
    ```
